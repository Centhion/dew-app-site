**Dew — Habit Tracker**

**Effective Date:** December 30, 2025
**Last Updated:** December 30, 2025

---

## Overview

Dew ("we," "our," or "the app") is a habit tracking application designed with your privacy in mind. We believe your personal habits are your business — not ours.

**The short version:** We collect almost nothing. Your habit data stays on your device. We don't have accounts, we don't track you, and we don't sell data because we don't have any to sell.

---

## Information We Collect

### Information Stored on Your Device (Local Only)

The following data is stored **locally on your device only** and is never transmitted to our servers:

- Habit names and settings you create
- Completion records and history
- App preferences (theme, notification settings, etc.)
- Any notes you add to habits

**We cannot access this data.** It exists only on your device and in your iCloud backup (if you have iCloud enabled on your device).

### Information We Do NOT Collect

We do not collect, store, or transmit:

- Your name or email address
- Location data
- Device identifiers for tracking purposes
- Usage analytics or behavioral data
- Health or fitness data beyond what you manually enter
- Any data that could personally identify you

### Information Collected by Third Parties

#### In-App Purchases (RevenueCat)

If you purchase Dew Pro, the transaction is processed by:

- **Apple App Store** (for iOS purchases)
- **RevenueCat** (our subscription management service)

These services may collect:
- Transaction records
- Anonymous subscription status
- Device identifiers for purchase restoration

RevenueCat's privacy policy: https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy

We receive only:
- Whether you have an active subscription (yes/no)
- Subscription type (monthly, annual, or lifetime)

We do **not** receive your name, email, payment details, or Apple ID.

#### Apple App Store

If you download the app from the Apple App Store, Apple may collect data according to their privacy policy. This is outside our control.

Apple's privacy policy: https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/

#### Crash Reporting (Optional)

If you opt in to share crash reports with Apple, anonymized crash data may be shared with us through App Store Connect. This data contains no personal information — only technical details about app crashes.

## How We Use Information

Since we don't collect personal information, we don't use it. 

The app functions entirely offline. Your data stays on your device.

---

## Data Storage and Security

### Local Storage

All your habit data is stored locally on your device using secure, encrypted storage provided by iOS.

### iCloud Backup

If you have iCloud Backup enabled on your device, your Dew data may be included in your device backup. This is controlled by your iOS settings, not by us.

### No Cloud Sync

Dew does not sync data to any cloud service. Your data exists only on the device where you created it.

---

## Data Retention

### On Your Device

Your data remains on your device until you:
- Delete individual habits
- Delete the app
- Erase your device

### Our Servers

We retain no user data on our servers because we don't collect any.

### Subscription Records

RevenueCat and Apple retain transaction records according to their respective policies and legal requirements.

---

## Your Rights and Choices

### Access and Deletion

Your data is on your device. You have complete control:

- **View your data:** Open the app anytime
- **Delete specific habits:** Swipe to delete or use edit mode
- **Delete all data:** Delete the app from your device

### Opt-Out

There's nothing to opt out of — we don't track you.

### Do Not Track

We honor Do Not Track signals by default because we don't track anyone.

---

## Children's Privacy

Dew does not knowingly collect any personal information from anyone, including children under 13. Since we don't collect personal information, we don't collect it from children either.

The app contains no user accounts, social features, or data collection mechanisms that would raise children's privacy concerns.

If you are a parent or guardian and believe we have inadvertently collected information about your child, please contact us and we will investigate.

---

## International Users

Dew can be used anywhere in the world. Since we don't collect personal data:

- No data is transferred internationally
- GDPR, CCPA, and similar regulations are satisfied by our data minimization approach
- Your data stays on your device in your jurisdiction

---

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by:

- Updating the "Last Updated" date at the top
- Posting the new policy in the app

Your continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.
