### Your Content

Any habits, notes, or data you create within the app remain your property. We do not claim ownership of your content.

By using the app, you grant us no rights to your content because your content stays on your device and we have no access to it.

### Open Source and Third-Party Licenses

The app may include open-source software components subject to their own licenses. A list of third-party licenses is available within the app under Settings → About → Licenses.

Dew offers optional premium features ("Dew Pro") available through in-app purchase:

- **Monthly subscription:** $2.99/month
- **Annual subscription:** $19.99/year
- **Lifetime purchase:** $79.99 one-time

Prices may vary by region and are subject to change.

### Payment Processing

All purchases are processed through the Apple App Store. By making a purchase, you agree to Apple's terms and conditions.

We do not directly handle payment information. All billing inquiries should be directed to Apple.

### Subscription Terms

**Auto-Renewal:** Monthly and annual subscriptions automatically renew unless canceled at least 24 hours before the end of the current period.

**Cancellation:** You may cancel your subscription at any time through your Apple ID account settings. Cancellation takes effect at the end of the current billing period.

**No Partial Refunds:** If you cancel mid-period, you retain access until the end of that period but will not receive a partial refund.

### Refunds

Refund requests must be submitted to Apple, as they handle all billing:
https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204084

We cannot process refunds directly.

### Lifetime Purchase

The lifetime purchase grants access to Dew Pro features for the lifetime of the product. "Lifetime" refers to the useful life of the app, not your lifetime. If we discontinue the app entirely, lifetime purchases will not be refunded, but you will retain access as long as the app functions on your device.

### Price Changes

We reserve the right to change subscription prices. Existing subscribers will be notified before price changes affect their renewal.
